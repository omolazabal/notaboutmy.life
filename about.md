Well... It's based off of random things I find interesting. I used the pronoun "I"... so I guess I should elaborate a little on who "I" is.

This is what "I" kinda looks like.

"I" is me, and me is Oscar Olazabal. That's pronounced "Ola-Za-Ball". It's Spanish and apparently there is a professional [Spanish golfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mar%C3%ADa_Olaz%C3%A1bal) with the same last name. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olaz%C3%A1bal) is some more notable people with the surname Olazabal, if you'd like to waste a little bit of time.


Anyways, I'm a 23 year-old guy who enjoys making things and teaching people. I assume this is because I spent a lot of my youth playing video games that spark creativity (Halo 3's Forge, Minecraft, Guitar Hero, Little Big Planet, to name a few) and being very helpful and expressive about them on various online forums. I say "expressive," but I really mean being a typical angry internet child. That is not too important, however.

The important thing to extract from all that is that this website will consists of random topics that I find intriguing. Such as:
<ul>
    <li>Software engineering</li>
    <li>Computer science research</li>
    <li>Music equipment & music production</li>
    <li>Cooking</li>
    <li>Other random shenanigans</li>
</ul>

Hopefully your topics of interest align with mine... if not, then I am sorry I've failed you.

You might also be asking, "Why did you create this website?". To be honest, I don't have a specific reason as to why. It could be because, at the time of writing this, I am in the midst of the [2019-2020 Coronavirus Pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic) and have a little extra time on my hands due to the quarantine. Or it could be because people always tend to ask me how I did "X" and "Y" and writing up posts with regards to "X" and "Y" would make a better medium for explaination. Or because I enjoy explaining things. Or maybe it is simply because, at the moment of making the website live, it was almost 4:00 AM and I was not thinking straight.

Regardless, hopefully I create at least one post that you'll find interesting.
